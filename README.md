## üõ†Ô∏è My Approach

- **Conditional Rendering:** Game states (win, lose, in-progress) are handled with clear, dynamic rendering.
- **Modern Utilities:**  
    - [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) for elegant className management.
    - [`react-confetti`](https://github.com/alampros/react-confetti) for celebratory effects.
